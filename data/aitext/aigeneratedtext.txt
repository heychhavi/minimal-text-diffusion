In 1985, a small plane carrying a load of cocaine crashed in the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia. The crash site was discovered by a US Forest Service worker, who found a bear munching on the drugs. The bear had gotten into the drug shipment - which was estimated to be worth over $15 million - and had eaten around 20 pounds of cocaine. The bear was dubbed ""Cocaine Bear,"" and the story quickly became a source of folk legend.

The incident gained even more traction when news outlets started to report on it, and in 2009, the story was adapted into a mockumentary called “Cocaine Bear: The Legend of Elrod,” which was released on YouTube.

Now, the story of the Cocaine Bear is getting the big-screen treatment. The film, ""Cocaine Bear,"" follows the story of a young bear cub named Elrod who is raised by drug smugglers in the 1980s. After the plane carrying a shipment of cocaine crashes in the national forest, Elrod is forced to fend for himself and learns to survive in the wild. The film stars Andrew Lincoln, Jessica Chastain, and Woody Harrelson.

In 1985, a large black bear was discovered in the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia with a strange story. The bear had been spotted by hunters, and it was waddling around with a dead man’s body in its mouth. After further investigation, it was discovered that the man had died from a drug overdose and that the bear had been scavenging the body for food. What was even more bizarre was that the bear had managed to open the man’s backpack and consume the contents, which included over 75 pounds of cocaine that had been packed in plastic bags.

The bear was found to have a level of cocaine in its bloodstream that was seven times higher than the lethal dose for humans. It was eventually euthanized due to its extreme agitation and aggression. The animal’s strange tale has since become a popular urban legend, and experts have warned against feeding wild animals, as it can pose a significant risk to both the animals and humans."

To make it, start by heating some oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add in a pound of ground pork and cook until no longer pink, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Add in some minced garlic and dried herbs such as oregano, thyme, and rosemary, and season with salt and pepper. Cook for a few minutes until the herbs are fragrant.

Next, add 1 cup of long-grain white rice and stir to combine. Pour in 2 cups of chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and simmer for about 18 minutes, or until the rice is tender.

Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Add in a large head of thinly sliced cabbage and sauté for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden and caramelized.

Once the pork and rice is done, remove it from the heat and fluff the rice with a fork. To assemble the skillet, layer the cabbage over the bottom of the skillet, followed by the pork and rice mixture. Top with the remaining cabbage and press it down into the mixture with a spoon.

Igor Girkin, who is better known as Strelkov, accused Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov of “betrayal” and “treason” for their handling of the conflict in Ukraine. He claimed that Shoigu and Gerasimov had failed to support the Wagner Group’s efforts in Ukraine and had instead provided “weak” support to Ukrainian forces. 

Girkin’s accusations came during a live interview on Russian television, in which he also accused the Russian government of not providing the Wagner Group with sufficient resources and support. He also accused the government of “manipulating” the group’s activities. 

Girkin’s accusations are the latest in a series of high-profile disputes between the Russian government and the Wagner Group, which is a private military organization founded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Wagner Group has been accused of carrying out military operations in Ukraine, Syria, and other parts of the world, and Prigozhin has been sanctioned by the United States for his role in the group.

Effective altruism is a movement focused on using evidence and reason to determine how to most effectively improve the world. It is based on the idea that people should use their resources and talents to do the most good for others. Effective altruists strive to identify the causes that can most effectively benefit the greatest number of people, and then prioritize those causes accordingly. 

In addition to its philosophical implications, effective altruism also has practical applications. Jane Street Capital, for example, encourages its employees to donate a percentage of their salaries to charity. The company also has a program that matches employee donations up to $2,500 per year. 

Ultimately, effective altruism is about using resources to do the most good. It is a movement that is gaining traction, and Bankman-Fried's career at Jane Street Capital is a testament to its potential."

The EU has a Passenger Rights Regulation (EC 261/2004) that outlines what passengers are entitled to when a flight is cancelled or significantly delayed. These rules apply to all flights within the EU, to flights from the EU to a non-EU country, and to all flights operated by an EU-based airline. The rules vary depending on the length of the flight and the delay or cancellation, but passengers are generally entitled to a full refund, compensation for meals and hotels, and assistance for re-booking flights.

That said, Lufthansa has a long history of disregarding these rules and offering unsatisfactory compensation to passengers when their flights are cancelled or delayed. In September 2017, the German government passed a new law that requires airlines to abide by the EU regulations and take responsibility for any delays or cancellations that are within their control.

Recently, one of our readers reached out to me with a complaint about their experience flying with Lufthansa. They had a flight from Frankfurt to New York that was cancelled due to a mechanical issue.

The New START treaty, which was signed in 2010 and is due to expire in 2021, is a legally binding treaty between Russia and the United States that limits the number of strategic nuclear weapons they can deploy. It was the last remaining arms control agreement between the two countries, and its collapse would leave the world without a formal mechanism to control the nuclear arsenals of the two largest nuclear powers.

With the collapse of the New START treaty, the world is entering a new era in which both Russia and the United States are free to increase their nuclear arsenals without any limits. This could lead to an arms race between the two countries, as both seek to build up their nuclear arsenals in an effort to gain a military advantage. It could also lead to a situation in which the risk of nuclear war increases, as the two countries are no longer bound by any formal agreement to limit the number of nuclear weapons they can deploy.

It is unclear what, if anything, will replace the New START treaty as a mechanism for controlling the nuclear arsenals of the two countries. It is possible that some kind of informal arrangement could be reached between the two countries, but it is likely that any such arrangement would be much less effective than a formal treaty.

The 7.0 magnitude quake that rocked the Aegean Sea was Turkey’s deadliest in a decade, killing at least 109 people and injuring more than 1,000. It toppled dozens of buildings in the cities of Izmir and Mugla and left dozens of people trapped beneath the rubble.

Rescue crews have worked tirelessly all week, often in the dark and in perilous conditions. At the same time, they have had to cope with the emotional toll of finding bodies, many of them children, in the debris.

One rescuer, Hasan Cetin, said he was motivated by the thought of the survivors he helped save.

“The moment when a man or a child is pulled out of the ruins, the joy of seeing them come back to life is indescribable,” Cetin told The Associated Press. “This is why we keep on going.”

At least six people were killed and more than 30 were injured, according to the Ukrainian government. The shelling reportedly caused significant damage to the bus station, including shattered windows and damaged vehicles.

The shelling is the latest in an ongoing offensive by Russian forces against Ukrainian targets. In recent weeks, Russia has intensified its shelling of Ukrainian cities, including Kherson, as Ukrainian forces have been pushing back against Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country.

The pandemic has caused a major disruption in global supply chains, forcing companies to reexamine their sources of production and distribution. That’s especially true for Mexico, where Chinese companies have started setting up shop to be closer to their biggest customer – the United States. 

The shift has been driven by the pandemic’s effects on shipping, which has become more expensive and unreliable. As a result, some Chinese companies have decided to set up production and distribution centers in Mexico, where they can be closer to their most important customer. This has been a boon for Mexico, which is experiencing an influx of Chinese investments and thousands of new jobs.

But there have also been negative effects. Mexico’s economy is heavily reliant on the US, and the influx of Chinese companies has caused competition and put pressure on the wages of local workers.

The concern is that hard sodas may bridge the gap between soft drinks and alcohol, potentially leading some young people to start drinking earlier or more often than they otherwise would. In addition, the drinks contain more calories and sugar than regular sodas, raising further health concerns. While the drinks have been marketed as an alternative for those who want to reduce their alcohol consumption, health experts fear that the drinks may end up being consumed in combination with alcohol, leading to increased rates of binge drinking.

The shelling is part of a broader strategy to weaken Ukraine’s military capabilities in the south and prevent it from launching a counter-offensive.

Smith was born in New Orleans in 1930, and developed a fascination with the piano at a young age. He was a self-taught musician, learning to play the instrument intuitively and with an innate sense of rhythm.

Biden assured Ukraine of America’s unwavering commitment to its security, and delivered a strong rebuke of Russian aggression. He also pledged more financial support and announced a new “energy cooperation initiative” to help Ukraine reduce its dependence on Russian energy.

The visit was warmly welcomed by Ukrainians, with many expressing gratitude for the US’s support. “It’s a very important day for us,” said one woman. “It’s an honor for us to have Biden here.”"

Putin is expected to focus his speech on Russian foreign policy and the relationship between Russia and the West. It is likely that he will attempt to project a strong image of Russia as a powerful nation and a reliable partner on the global stage. 

Meanwhile, Biden is likely to focus his speech on democracy, human rights, and the importance of the transatlantic alliance. He will likely emphasize that the United States stands with those who seek freedom and will defend democratic values. Biden is also expected to stress the importance of collective action to address global challenges and to confront authoritarianism. 

The speeches will be a reflection of the divergent values and approaches of the two countries. Both leaders will be trying to set the tone for their countries’ relationship going forward."

The Bedford Fire Department said the explosion happened around 8:30 a.m. on Thursday at the industrial complex on Northfield Road. Several agencies responded to the scene, including the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner’s Office and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). 

The Bedford Fire Chief, Robert Walker, said that the explosion was so powerful that it blew out the walls and roof of the building. He added that the debris from the explosion fell onto the nearby highway, causing traffic delays. 

The authorities have not yet released the identity of the person who died. 

The ATF is leading the investigation into the cause of the explosion. ATF Special Agent in Charge Stephen D. Francis said that the agency is working with local law enforcement and fire agencies to determine the cause of the explosion.

1. Listen. Being a good listener means actively paying attention to what the person is saying and expressing genuine interest in their feelings. Don't start offering advice right away. Allow the person to express their feelings without judgement.

2. Ask open-ended questions. Asking questions that can't be answered with a simple yes or no can help the person explore their feelings and provide opportunities for deeper conversations.

3. Offer empathy. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. Reassure them that you understand how they feel and that their feelings are valid.

4. Offer support. Let the person know that you are there for them and that you are willing to offer any kind of help they may need.

5.Be patient. Each person is different and healing takes time. Don't rush the process and be patient with the person as they work through their emotions.

6.Check in. Following up with the person long after the initial conversation can help them feel heard and supported. Even a simple text message or call can go a long way in showing that you care."

The NBA Slam Dunk Contest has been a staple of All-Star Weekend since 1984. Every year, a few of the league’s most electrifying dunkers face off in a battle of gravity-defying creativity. The contest has become a showcase for the best dunkers in the game, as well as a chance for lesser-known players to make a name for themselves. 

The competition is judged by a panel of former players and celebrities, and the winner is determined by a combination of fan voting and the judges’ scores. The contest has featured some of the best dunks in NBA history, from Dominique Wilkins’s legendary “rock the cradle” dunk in 1985 to Blake Griffin’s jaw-dropping between-the-legs jam in 2011.

The Supreme Court decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) upheld affirmative action policies in the context of university admissions. The Court ruled that while universities could take race into consideration when making admissions decisions, they could not create a quota system that set aside a certain number of spots for minority applicants. This decision allowed universities to maintain affirmative action policies while also preventing them from creating a system of racial preferences.

However, this decision also set the stage for future challenges to affirmative action. In the years since, affirmative action policies have been the subject of multiple Supreme Court cases, and in some cases, such as in Fisher v. University of Texas (2016), the Court has ruled that affirmative action policies must be narrowly tailored to address a specific problem. The Bakke decision thus may have helped to set affirmative action on a path to being more closely scrutinized and possibly even outlawed in some cases."

McAnally’s influence in the genre has been far reaching. He has written and produced songs for some of the biggest names in country music, including Kacey Musgraves, Sam Hunt, Midland, and Kenny Chesney. He has also established himself as an A&R executive and co-founder of the label Monument Records. His success in this role has been especially impressive, given that it has been achieved in a genre that has traditionally been slow to accept LGBTQ artists. 

McAnally has also been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ rights in the country music industry, speaking out against discriminatory practices and encouraging artists to be open and honest about their identities. He has even been credited with popularizing the term “queer country,” which has become a rallying cry for many LGBTQ country music fans. He has also used his influence to support and promote LGBTQ-inclusive songs and artists, including those on his own label. 

By helping to create a more inclusive climate in country music, McAnally has become an important figure in the genre, and a symbol of hope for LGBTQ fans and artists alike."

This is a difficult situation, and it’s important to consider the potential consequences of your actions. It’s understandable that you want to help your friend, but it’s important to make sure that your intentions are coming from a place of care and not judgement. 

It's important to remember that it's not your place to diagnose your friend, as this requires specialized training and knowledge. It’s also important to be respectful of her wishes. If she does not consider herself to be on the spectrum, it’s best to respect her boundaries. 

That said, it’s important to keep in mind that it can be helpful to have a diagnosis in order to gain access to resources and support. It may be helpful to suggest that she speak with a mental health professional about her concerns. This could be a therapist, psychiatrist, or psychologist. If your friend is open to it, you could offer to accompany her to the appointment or help her find a provider that might be a good fit. 

It’s also important to consider how your friend might react if you bring up the topic. It’s best to do it in a supportive and non-judgmental way."

The experience was both miraculous and heartbreaking. It was a glimpse of the potential of her body that was taken away in an instant by the stroke. But it also wasn’t a permanent fix — when the study ended, so did her newfound abilities. 

Rendulic’s experience illustrates the potential of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) to help people with paralysis regain some mobility. SCS is a form of neuromodulation, which involves stimulating the nervous system with electrical pulses to restore movement and sensation.

When Rendulic had SCS, researchers implanted electrodes into her spinal cord and connected them to a stimulator. The stimulator delivered electrical pulses to her spinal cord, allowing her brain to more easily send signals to her arms and legs.

The results were remarkable. Rendulic was able to move her left hand in ways she hadn’t been able to since her stroke. She was also able to stand for extended periods of time with little effort.

Though the effects of SCS are not permanent, the results suggest that it could be a promising treatment for paralysis. SCS could be a way to help those with paralysis regain some of their function, even if it is only temporary."

The idea of recognizing the nation's first president's birthday dates back to the late 1700s, when Washington was still alive. The first official recognition of Washington's birthday came in 1796, when Congress enacted an act to honor the former president. 

In the late 1800s, some states created holidays to honor Washington, and a few even combined Washington's and Abraham Lincoln's birthdays into a single day. It wasn't until the late 1960s that the effort to make Presidents' Day a federal holiday gained traction. 

In 1968, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which sought to create more three-day weekends by celebrating certain holidays on Monday rather than their traditional dates. Washington's Birthday was moved from Feb. 22 to the third Monday in February. 

The holiday was originally referred to as ""Washington's Birthday"" in the act. But, as the holiday gained prominence in the 1970s, some states began referring to it as ""Presidents' Day"" to acknowledge not only Washington, but other presidents, too. 

Today, the holiday is officially referred to as ""Washington's Birthday"" in federal law. Meanwhile, some states, such as California, officially refer to the holiday as ""Presidents' Day"

The U.S. and the Philippines have long had a security alliance, but the relationship has frayed in recent years under President Rodrigo Duterte. President Marcos is now seeking to rebuild the alliance and has opened talks with the White House on a new defense treaty. He has also reached out to the U.S. for help in modernizing the Philippine military, which has been outmatched by Beijing's rapidly expanding forces in the contested South China Sea.

The U.S. has responded favorably to Marcos' overtures, deepening security and economic ties with the country. The Biden administration has pledged $300 million in economic aid to the Philippines, and the two countries are expected to soon sign a new defense pact that would allow for greater military cooperation.

At issue is a 1996 law enacted in the era of dial-up modems that shields tech companies from being held liable for material posted by their users. The case, to be argued Wednesday, could determine whether the law applies to a wide range of tech services, and if so, how far the protections extend. 

The case was brought by the family of a New York man who was killed in a terrorist attack in Israel in 2015. The family claims that Facebook, Google and Twitter provided “material support” to the terrorist group that carried out the attack by allowing it to post propaganda and solicit funds on their sites. 

The companies deny the charges, arguing that the 1996 law protects them from liability for content posted by users. They also argue that allowing such suits would have a chilling effect on free speech, as social media companies would be forced to police the content their users post online. 

The outcome of the case is sure to have a major impact on social media companies and the internet as a whole. If the court rules against the tech companies, it could open the door to a wave of lawsuits and force the companies to become more aggressive in policing user content. On the other hand, if the court upholds the 1996"

Many of the patients interviewed by The New York Times said they felt ketamine had been life-changing, with some claiming it had eased their depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. However, some patients described serious drawbacks to taking ketamine. 

These drawbacks included physical side effects such as headaches, nausea, and dizziness. Other side effects included disorientation, confusion, hallucinations and delusions. Some patients also reported feeling more anxious after taking the drug, and some reported feeling a sense of detachment from their body and mind. 

Though ketamine has been approved by the FDA for certain uses, it is still largely considered an experimental drug, and the long-term effects of taking it are not yet fully known. As such, it is important to weigh the potential benefits and risks of taking ketamine before deciding to take it."

The planning for the trip began shortly after Biden was elected President in November 2020. The National Security Council (NSC) began working on the logistics, coordinating with the State Department, Pentagon, and other government agencies. The NSC also worked with Ukrainian officials to finalize the details of the trip.

On the morning of April 22nd, 2021, the White House announced the trip and released a brief statement. The statement gave very few details, including a few key objectives for the trip, such as strengthening the U.S.-Ukraine alliance and reaffirming America's support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Before leaving for Ukraine, President Biden held a press conference, during which he announced the trip and outlined his objectives. He also warned Russia against any attempts to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that opioid overdoses in the United States have steadily increased since 1999, reaching a peak in 2017. In New York City, the number of overdose deaths has been rising since 2015. The city saw a surge in opioid overdoses in 2020, likely due to the pandemic. 

The coronavirus pandemic has caused a variety of economic and social disruptions that may have contributed to the increase in drug use and overdoses in New York City. The stress and uncertainty of the pandemic has been linked to increased substance abuse, and social distancing measures have made it more difficult for people to access substance abuse treatment and support. The economic downturn has also been linked to increased drug use and overdoses, as people may have turned to drugs as a way to cope with financial hardship. 

The New York City government has taken action to address the overdose crisis, including launching a public health campaign to educate people about the risks of opioids, launching an opioid response plan, and increasing access to naloxone, a life-saving medication used to reverse overdoses."

The story of Presidents’ Day begins in 1885, when Congress passed an act to create a federal holiday honoring George Washington’s birthday. The holiday was celebrated on February 22, the anniversary of Washington’s birth in 1732. 

In 1968, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which moved a number of federal holidays to Mondays in order to create more three-day weekends. This move shifted the observance of Washington’s Birthday to the third Monday in February. 

The name of the holiday was changed in the 1980s, when Congress passed a bill officially called the “Presidential Election Day Act.” This bill was meant to move the date of the presidential election day from November to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. But because the bill was passed during the Reagan administration, it was seen as an effort to honor the current president, and the name of the holiday was changed from Washington’s Birthday to Presidents’ Day.

Although the name of the holiday has changed, most states still recognize the day as a celebration of George Washington’s birthday. Some states, such as California and Florida, have officially changed their state holiday to Presidents’ Day and honor"

The modern holiday of Presidents' Day was born out of the efforts of the labor movement to give Americans a three-day weekend. In 1968, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which established the modern system of federal holidays on Mondays. As part of the law, Washington's Birthday was moved from its traditional February 22nd date to the third Monday of February. 

The holiday was originally created to honor George Washington’s birthday, but some states have since decided to use it to also recognize other presidents. This has led to the informal name of “Presidents’ Day”. 

Presidents’ Day is often celebrated with parades, fireworks, and other festivities. Some communities also host presidential look-alike contests and other activities. Despite its name, the holiday is still officially designated as Washington’s Birthday."
